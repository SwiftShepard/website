      "longDescription": "As the lead 3D artist on Star Gardener, I played a key role in shaping the game’s artistic direction and producing its visual elements.\n\nMain Character\nModeling, Texturing & Shaders: I created the 3D model, textures, and a custom shader to seamlessly fit the game’s aesthetic.\nRigging & Skinning: I handled the rigging and skinning, ensuring smooth deformations and optimized integration for animation and gameplay.\nEnvironment\nRock Assets: I modeled and textured various rock formations, contributing to the game's visual identity and atmosphere.\nProcedural Materials: I developed materials in Substance Designer, including sand and grass, to create high-quality, optimized surfaces.\nCustom Grass in Unreal Engine: I designed a custom grass system using advanced shaders and a custom wind effect, enhancing realism and immersion.\nMy work helped establish a strong artistic cohesion for Star Gardener while optimizing performance for a smooth and immersive experience.\n\nYou can download the game on itch.io : https://loyyxa.itch.io/star-gardener",
